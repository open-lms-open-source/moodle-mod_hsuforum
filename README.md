# Open Forum Activity

Open forums enhance Moodle Forums by providing teachers and students with quick,
simple views into the forums and their discussions. Allowing users to sort and search
discussions easily and in multiple layouts is key to Advanced Forums increased usability.
Read tracking is a feature in Advanced forums that highlights unread posts,
making it even easier to manage a forum. This saves the student time in viewing and
responding to posts, and saves the teacher time in finding the posts that are most
relevant to the class. Teachers are empowered to create anonymous interactions with
students while still being able to provide accurate grading with advanced grading methods.
