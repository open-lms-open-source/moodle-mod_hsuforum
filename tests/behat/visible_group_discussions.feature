Feature: Posting to all groups in Open Forums in a visible group discussion is restricted to users with access to all groups
  In order to post to all groups in a forum with visible groups
  As a teacher
  I need to have the accessallgroups capability

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
      | student2 | Student | 2 | student2@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1 | student |
      | student2 | C1 | student |
    And the following "groups" exist:
      | name | course | idnumber |
      | Group A | C1 | G1 |
      | Group B | C1 | G2 |
      | Group C | C1 | G3 |
    And the following "group members" exist:

      | student2 | G2 |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity   | name                   | intro                         | course | idnumber     | groupmode |
      | hsuforum   | Standard forum name    | Standard forum description    | C1     | groups       | 2         |

    Then the "Visible groups" select box should contain "Group A"
    Then the "Visible groups" select box should contain "Group B"
